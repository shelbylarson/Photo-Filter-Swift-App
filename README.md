# Photo-Filter-Swift-App

77Share is an app that combines filtering photos and being able to share them with other people.

The two 7's stand for the 7 filters that you can use and being able to use them to access all 7

colors of the rainbow. We chose to build this app because we wanted to have an app where we gathered

what we thought were the best filters (with our version of XCode) and put them all into one app. Our 

team name, Shelahai, is a combination of both our first and last names: SHElby LArson and LAura HAIley.


//App Icon

For the icon, we wanted a similar theme with a cleaner approach; we didn't want to have an icon with a 

cluttered background that you wouldn't even be able to see what the pictures were. We liked the idea of 

connecting the 7's to make it look like a reflection, so we took that idea and went with it. 



//Launch Screen:

We thought that the best representation of our app would be shown through photos of people taking selfies 

because, according to Samsung, selfies make up 30% of photos taken by people between the ages of 18-24, 

which represents a large margin for whom our app is targeted towards.



*/*Instructions*\*


//The Basics

When you run the app, you MUST first add a picture to begin the filter process. To do this, click the 

camera icon in the top right corner. From there, you can choose any photo from your camera roll to add a 

filter to. Once you have decided on a photo, click on it. The picture you chose will come up on a screen 

to confirm that is the right image; if so, select "Choose", and if not, select "Cancel", which will take 

you back to your camera roll to choose a different photo.


//Filtering a Photo

Once you click the "Choose" button, you will go to a new screen where you can begin filtering your image. 

You can use the preset one that automatically shows up, or you can change the filter by selecting the 

"Change Filter" button. From there, you can pick any one of the 7 filters. To adjust the intensity of the

filters, use the slider located at the bottom of the screen. When you have your photo filtered just the

way you like it, click "Share". From here, you can complete multiple different actions to share this image

with whomever you like. You can share it via e-mail, iCloud Photo Sharing, or any social media apps that 

you have on your device. You can also save it to your camera roll, aassign it to a contact, and copy or 

print it. 



*/*The Coding Process*\*

To build this app, we took bits of code from various sources and made it our own. We learned how to make

certain filters work by adding code that could change the intensity of certain parameters, such as saturation

or sharpness. We also learned how to add an activity view controller to be able to share your filtered photo

with others or save it to your camera roll. The purpose of this app is to be able to improve your photos with

filters before sharing them with friends or family.
